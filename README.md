# elaineDanahy-portfolio

This web application is my portfolio. It is designed to be a future hub for web development projects.

## How it was made

This portfolio was developed using HTML and CSS.

The viewer is provided both a picture and short description of me. 

It has been made responsive to different screen sizes with the use of Media Queries and FlexBox Features. 

The links in the nav bar and contact section take the viewer to where they intend to go. 

The pictures will act as links to future projects as they are completed (right now they just present as a link button).
